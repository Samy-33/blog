        <h1><a href="neovim-clojure-pde-1.html">Neovim as the Clojure PDE - I</a></h1>
        <p>Hello, fellow text editor enthusiasts. Welcome to <em>Abstract Symphony</em>, meaning of which, nobody knows and has nothing to do with the post's agenda.</p><p>You may gently ask for the meaning of PDE, what the fuck does that mean?</p><p>Well, you don't have to be so rude. It's an abbreviation for <em>Personalized Development Environment</em>, coined by <a href='https://twitter.com/teej_dv'>TJ</a>, Neovim's marketing head.</p><h3 id="why&#95;neovim?">Why Neovim?</h3><p>You know, same old bullshit like speed, muscle memory, extension of your body/mind, spiritualism, nirvana, moksha and so on. Nothing serious. Jokes aside, the real reason was seeing how fast <a href='https://twitter.com/ThePrimeagen'>Prime</a> was, in <a href='https://youtu.be/SGBuBSXdtLY?si=0HJtUqZEIT3B3izX&t=69'>giving up</a> on clojure.</p><h3 id="why&#95;clojure?">Why Clojure?</h3><p>Because I love my high functioning parens. I can lisp down, 100s of reasons why, but that's beyond the scope. This emotion is hosted on a solid and reliable foundation. I am sure, a dynamic and immutable relationship is what keeps us tied together so strongly. Please forgive me, for my love for punning (nil?). <a href='https://clojure.org/about/rationale'>IYKYK</a>.</p><h3 id="init.lua">init.lua</h3><p>Neovim is a professional's tool. You need to deserve it, earn its respect, you know? Like Thor and his hammer.</p><p>Or you can just <a href='https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md'>install</a> neovim and get started. At first sight, it doesn't look like anything more than a trap that you can never get out of (trust me you can :q!). And no, that was not my failed attempt at putting an emojee.</p><p>Create an <code>init.lua</code> file in <code>$HOME/.config/nvim</code> directory. This will be the entrypoint for your neovim configuration. It's similar to the <code>main</code> method in a java/c/cpp projects, an entry-point for the program to run.</p><p>Go ahead and add a <code>print&#40;&quot;Hello, world!&quot;&#41;</code> to the file. Now, when you run <code>nvim</code>, you should see <code>Hello, world!</code> at the bottom-left of your screen. Congratulations, for your first configured neovim instance.</p><h3 id="leader&#95;and&#95;localleader">Leader and LocalLeader</h3><p>Just like how each country needs good leaders to function properly, neovim is no different. You should define a leader and localleader according to your convenience. People usually choose <code>&lt;Space&gt;</code> or <code>&quot;,&quot;</code> as their leader. I'll go ahead with <code>&quot;,&quot;</code> as that is what I am used to.</p><p>But wait, what is the purpose of the leaders, you ask? Well, the main reason is the <code>&quot;plugins&quot;</code>. Plugin writers are not aware of how you have configured your editor. They can't arbitrarily setup keybindings in their plugins, as they may conflict with your bindings.</p><p>Neovim API exposes options via <code>vim.g</code>, <code>vim.o</code>, <code>vim.opt</code>, <code>vim.bo</code> and <code>vim.wo</code>. We can control behaviour of Neovim by setting these options. <code>vim.g</code> is used for <code>global</code> scoped options. We can read more about them in Neovim's help text using <code>:help vim.g</code> or <code>:help vim.o</code> etc.</p><p>Let's set our globally scoped leader and localleader.</p><pre><code class="lang-lua">-- init.lua
vim.g.mapleader = ','
vim.g.maplocalleader = ','
</code></pre><p><strong>NSFW</strong>: <a href='https://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/06.html'>This article</a> goes deeper into how leader/localleader is helpful.</p><h3 id="we'll&#95;use&#95;fennel&#95;as&#95;our&#95;config&#95;language">We'll use Fennel as our config language</h3><p>Although, Neovim officially supports lua as its configuration language, we will use <a href='https://fennel-lang.org/'>Fennel</a>. Because, we love our parens. And also, we like to struggle and learn.</p><p>Fennel transpiles into lua, so we need a Neovim plugin to transpile our fennel files into lua. Olical's <a href='https://github.com/Olical/nfnl'>nfnl</a> does exactly that. We will update our <code>init.lua</code> to download <code>nfnl</code>. We will also add nfnl's path to neovim's runtime path, so that it can find <code>nfnl</code> plugin.</p><pre><code class="lang-lua">-- init.lua
-- ...

local nfnl&#95;path = vim.fn.stdpath 'data' .. '/lazy/nfnl'

if not vim.uv.fs&#95;stat&#40;nfnl&#95;path&#41; then
  print&#40;&quot;Could not find nfnl, cloning new copy to&quot;, nfnl&#95;path&#41;
  vim.fn.system&#40;{'git', 'clone', 'https://github.com/Olical/nfnl', nfnl&#95;path}&#41;
end

vim.opt.rtp:prepend&#40;nfnl&#95;path&#41;

require&#40;'nfnl'&#41;.setup&#40;&#41;
</code></pre><p>We define a local variable <code>nfnl&#95;path</code>. It holds the directory path where we will download <code>nfnl</code>.</p><ul><li><strong>vim.fn.stdpath 'data'</strong> returns neovim's <code>data</code> directory.<blockquote><p> <code>:help stdpath</code> to know more about standard paths. </li><li>"<strong>..</strong>" is lua's string concatenation operator. So essentially, we get neovim's standard data path and append <code>/lazy/nfnl</code> to it. We'll store <code>nfnl</code> here.</li><li><strong>vim.uv.fs&#95;stat(nfnl_path)</strong> returns information about file/directory. If the file doesn't exist, it returns nil.</li><li><strong>vim.fn.system</strong> allows us to execute shell commands. We can also use <code>vim.system&#40;...&#41;</code> instead. They are exactly the same.</li><li>We ran <code>git clone</code> to download nfnl from its official github repository.</li><li>Then we added <code>nfnl&#95;path</code> to the neovim's runtime path.</li><li>At last, we require the <code>nfnl</code> module and call <code>setup</code> on it.</li></ul></p></blockquote><p>Let us create a directory to store our fennel config files. And also a <code>core.fnl</code> file inside that directory.</p><pre><code class="lang-sh"># Creates the directory
mkdir -p $HOME/.config/nvim/fnl/user

# Creates the file
touch $HOME/.config/nvim/fnl/user/core.fnl
</code></pre><p>Let's add a simple <code>Hello, world!</code> print form in our <code>core.fnl</code>.<pre><code class="lang-fnl">;; core.fnl
&#40;println &quot;Hello, world! This is fennel config!&quot;&#41;
</code></pre></p><p>When we restart our neovim instance, nothing happens. We should have seen a <i>hello world</i> message. We're missing a key <code>nfnl</code> config.</p><p><code>nfnl</code> looks for a <code>.nfnl.fnl</code> file in a directory for configuration about which files to compile and how. Create a <code>.nfnl.fnl</code> file with empty config in <code>$HOME/.config/nvim</code> directory.<pre><code class="lang-sh">echo {} &gt; $HOME/.config/nvim/.nfnl.fnl
</code></pre></p><p>When we restart our instance again, we still don't see anything printed. Well, there are a couple of things pending.</p><ul><li>Fennel files haven't been transpiled yet. <code>nfnl</code> transpiles <code>fnl</code> files on save by default.</li><li>In our <code>init.lua</code>, we haven't <code>require</code>d the <code>user.core</code>, so nvim doesn't know about it just yet.</li></ul><p>Let's open <code>core.fnl</code> and just save it by <code>:write</code>. You'll notice a prompt asking you to allow nfnl to transpile the files. Go ahead and allow it. When you look at the <code>$HOME/.config.nvim</code> directory, you should have a <code>lua</code> directory with transpiled lua code corresponding to the <code>core.fnl</code>.</p><p>Let's require <code>user/core</code> module in <code>init.lua</code><pre><code class="lang-lua">-- init.lua
-- ...
-- append this to the bottom of init.lua file.
require&#40;'user.core'&#41;
</code></pre></p><p>Now, when you restart neovim, it greets you with:<blockquote><p> Hello, world! This is fennel config!  </p></blockquote><h4 id="to&#95;be&#95;continued!">To be continued!</h4></p>

Mostly to frame my own thoughts in a structured manner and to keep a public record so others can relate or criticize.</p><p>Recently I found the amazing <a href='https://github.com/borkdude/quickblog'>quickblog</a>, that helped me get up and running with my first post within two hours.</p><p>Without wasting any more word, let's get started.</p><h2 id="outline">Outline</h2><p>In this post, we will</p><ul><li>Set up a blog repository using quickblog</li><li>Host it on github</li><li>Write a github action config to generate static files on push to <code>main</code> branch</li><li>Set up a CD pipeline on cloudflare to deploy the blog</li><li>Point a custom domain to the blog site</li></ul><h2 id="what&#95;is&#95;quickblog?">What is quickblog?</h2><p>Quickblog is a light-weight static blog engine for clojure and babashka. It allows you to write your posts in markdown, provides live reloading and generates SEO optimized static files.</p><h2 id="setting&#95;up&#95;quickblog">Setting up quickblog</h2><p>Create a directory that'll hold your blogging engine and blog posts. I will call it <code>blog</code>. Inside <code>blog</code> directory, create a <code>bb.edn</code> file. The structure looks like the following:</p><pre><code class="lang-sh">➜ tree blog 
blog
└── bb.edn

1 directory, 1 file
</code></pre><p>Let's add <em>quickblog</em> as a dependency in our <code>deps.edn</code>.</p><pre><code class="lang-edn">;; deps.edn
{:deps {io.github.borkdude/quickblog {:git/tag &quot;v0.3.6&quot;

</code></pre><p>Replace the <code>:git/tag</code> and <code>:git/sha</code> with the latest ones in <a href='https://github.com/borkdude/quickblog'>quickblog repository</a>.</p><p>Now we will add a babashka task that hooks into <code>quickblog</code> api and exposes it as a command line tool.</p><pre><code class="lang-edn">{:deps {...} ;; folded deps map

Quickblog command line has a <code>new</code> subcommand that allows us to do just that.</p><pre><code class="lang-sh">bb quickblog new --file my-first-blog-post.md --title &quot;My first blog post&quot;
</code></pre><p>The directory structure after the last command should look like the following<pre><code class="lang-sh">➜  blog tree .
.

└── posts
    └── my-first-blog-post.md

2 directories, 2 files
</code></pre></p><p>Run a live reloading server using <code>bb quickblog watch</code>, it spins up a http server on <code>localhost:1888</code> by default.</p><p>Write your blog post, initialize the <code>blog</code> directory as a git repository and commit your markdown changes. You would also want to add a <code>.gitignore</code> file that excludes some directories from committing like <code>.work</code>, <code>.lsp</code> and <code>.clj-kondo</code>. We will also exclude the <code>public</code> directory from the commit to keep the main branch clean.</p><h2 id="setting&#95;up&#95;github&#95;action">Setting up github action</h2><p>Via github action, we will</p><ul><li>Switch to <code>deploy</code> branch</li><li>Generate the static files</li><li>Commit and push them to the repository</li></ul><p>For this, we will need to allow github actions <code>write</code> permissions on the repository.</p><p>In your repository, go to the <strong>Settings > Actions > General</strong>.

Later, you can spericy more granular permissions <a href='https://docs.github.com/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow#modifying-the-permissions-for-the-github_token'>documented here</a>.</p><p>Create the github action config file: <code>.github/workflows/deploy.yml</code>.<pre><code class="lang-yml">on:

Apart from that the file should be self explanatory.</p><p>We will keep it in our local for now, and push it later to github.</p><h2 id="setting&#95;up&#95;cloudflare">Setting up cloudflare</h2><p>Create a new cloudflare account if you don't have it already. Log in to the account and go to <strong>Workers & Pages</strong> in the left panel.</p><ul><li>We will <em>create an application</em></li><li>Go to <strong>Pages</strong> tab.</li><li>And <strong>Connect to Git</strong></li></ul><p>A modal pops up, where you select your Github account and the repository to connect. You'll be redirected to github. Allow access to just the <code>blog</code> repository and continue.</p><p>Now we go to the next step, add the project name and set the <code>Production branch</code> to <strong>deploy</strong> and <code>Build output directory</code> to <strong>public</strong>. <em>Click and deploy</em>.</p><p>Cloudflare will consider changes on all the branches other than the <code>Production branch</code>, that we set in the previous step, as preview branches. This means that changes on these other branches will also trigger a build, consuming our precious build quota.</p><p>To disable the preview branches, we will go to the project we just setup <strong>-> Settings tab -> Build & deployment -> Configure preview deployments -> None -> Save</strong>. We are done with the setting up our cloudflare page. It should be visible at <code>&lt;project-identifier&gt;.pages.dev</code>.</p><blockquote><p> <strong>Note</strong>: Create the main and deploy branches and push them to our github repository. This will trigger github action build, after which cloudflare page build and you should see you first blog up on the url mentioned above. </p></blockquote><h2 id="setting&#95;up&#95;custom&#95;domain">Setting up custom domain</h2><p>Here I am assuming that you already have a domain bought and configured on cloudflare. If you don't, then there are a couple of platforms that I use to find and get best offer for domains:</p><ul><li><a href='https://www.namecheap.com/'>Namecheap</a></li><li><a href='https://www.godaddy.com/'>GoDaddy</a></li><li><a href='https://www.bigrock.in'>BigRock</a></li><li><a href='https://www.hostinger.in/domain-name-search'>Hostinger</a></li></ul><p>Once you get a domain, transfer it to cloudflare by following <a href='https://developers.cloudflare.com/registrar/get-started/transfer-domain-to-cloudflare/'>these steps</a>.</p><p>Setting up a custom domain for your page is simple. Open our page project, and go to <strong>Custom domains</strong> tab. Click on <strong>Set up a custom domain</strong> and follow the steps.</p><blockquote><p> <strong>PS</strong>: There are multiple ways to host your blog, and probably most of them would be simpler than this setup. It was my first time setting up my blog, and can certainly be improved. Will post an update when I migrate to a better pipeline. A similar post: <a href='https://www.eknert.com/blog/quickblog'>Quickblog by Anders Means Different</a> </p></blockquote><blockquote><p> If you find an error or have a question, open an <a href='https://github.com/Samy-33/blog/issues/new'>issue</a>. </p></blockquote>

I can not be grateful enough for this phase of my life.</p><p><img src="./assets/wedding.jpeg" alt="Wedding" width="100%" /></p><p>The wedding brought my family closer. It was tiring to the core to the whole family, but enjoyable nonetheless. I usually stay away from the crowd and excess stimuli but bent these boundaries for the family, and it turned out fine. Like all the things in nature, the excitement and joy came back to the normal level. Now, there are photos and videos of these moments, that we will cherish for the next several years.</p><h2 id="new&#95;job&#95;at&#95;oliv">New Job at Oliv</h2><p>I have an itch of experimenting and reading about new things, specifically in the technology industry. For the last couple of years, I wanted to read and learn about <a href='https://clojure.org/'>clojure</a> - a dynamic, functional and lisp flavoured programming language. The idea of REPLs fascinated me from the very first moment I read about them. So, I went ahead and tried to build a project with it. I failed miserably, it was hard to alter my thinking to align with the principles that clojure stood for.</p><p>Later when <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/dvdreddy/'>dvd</a> contacted me about joining Oliv in the mid 2023, I couldn't say no. One of the reasons was <em>clojure</em> based tech stack at Oliv.</p><p>I hopped on the clojure journey and haven't looked back. I've come to love clojure due to following reasons:</p><ul><li>REPL driven development</li><li>Relatively small and growth driven community</li><li>Open source orientation</li><li>Down to earth moderators and builders</li></ul><p>There are probably more, that I don't recall right now. Join the Official <a href='https://join.slack.com/t/clojurians/shared_invite/zt-29tr0sxes-m26dRDptHFQSdVULhDALgQ'>Clojurians Slack</a> if you're interested.</p><h2 id="books">Books</h2><p>Reading, as a habit, began when I faced an identity crisis during my undergraduate studies. I was looking to improve myself, probably due to self-esteem issues. Since then, I have been continuously reading psychology, philosophy and self-help non-fiction. At a point of time, I was only reading the books and nothing else.</p><p>2023 was a moderate reading year. I bought 20+ books, finished 1 and still reading 4-5 books at a time. It's become a hobby more than anything else now. Reading is a stress releaver.</p><p>Following is a list of books I read in 2023.</p><ul><li><strong>Courage to be disliked</strong>: A paradigm shift is rare, and this book did it in a way that hit close to home. It has a dialog based writing style and I could see myself in one of the two main characters. A beginner friendly introduction to Adlerian Psychology, that promotes the idea that all the problems we face are interpersonal relationship problems. We can solve these problems by helping others and seeing them as our comrades.</li><li><strong>The beginning of infinity</strong>: In my teenage and college years, I was fascinated, as well as, troubled by the fundamental questions about universe, our existence and the lack of their answers. This book doesn't answer these questions but adds more perspectives for us to think about them. Loved every chapter of it.</li><li><strong>Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement</strong>: This book gives an idea about how to prioritise our work and what goals should we strive for in it.</li><li><strong>Designing data intensive application</strong>: Well, what can I say except "read this instead of taking those system design preparation courses". An enjoyable read about how large systems work and their most fundamental pieces.</li><li><strong>Atomic Habits</strong>: Science and psychology based habit building. James Clear, the author, makes it an enjoyable read by adding short stories about small algorithms we can implement to build good and destroy bad habits.</li></ul><p>It is not an exhaustive list of books I read in 2023. The above is the ones that I found most interesting and would recommend everyone to read.</p><h2 id="writing">Writing</h2><p>I came across a few people in last few years that have inspired me to write. Writing also helps me arrange and sharpen my thoughts. Having a brain that is susceptible to distraction poses a different set of problems to the quality of conversations and thoughts.</p><p>I wanted to start writing but before that I needed to build a blogging platform with a great design and implementation in <code>clojure</code>. Unfortunately, I always procrastinated as it was no simple task.</p><p>Late in 2023, I was going through the mighty <a href='https://github.com/borkdude'>borkdude's</a> socials and found the <a href='https://github.com/borkdude/quickblog'>quickblog</a>, a light-weight static blog engine for Clojure and babashka. I was writing my first blog within a minute. Super grateful for this product. Thanks Michiel.</p><h2 id="goals&#95;for&#95;2024">Goals for 2024</h2><p>I am not one of those people who choose new year resolutions at the beginning of the year and as it passes, forgets about them.</p><p>On a high level, I want to work on my family and help them reach a place where they could focus on what's important (Story about this sometime later). Focus on my marriage and get the fundamentals right in terms of our plans and family. I would also like to improve and be cosistent in writing on this blog and reading the books that I couldn't finish in 2023.</p><p>These are the most important ones and I look forward to and wish you all have, a great new year.</p><h2 id="quote&#95;for&#95;the&#95;post">Quote for the post</h2><blockquote><p> God give me serenity to accepts things I can not change, the courage to change that I can and wisdom to know the difference. </p></blockquote>
